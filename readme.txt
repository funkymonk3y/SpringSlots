
Spring Slots is a quick demo application created initially for the CloudFoundry application contest within the SpringOne GX2 conference.  It allows conference attendees to relive the experience of collecting buttons and earning a SpringOne hoodie by playing a lucky 7s slots game.  Just click the spin button to play.  If one of the slots contains a "7", then you will win a nice prize: an image of the SpringOne hoodie (or what I like to call the digital virtual hoodie experience.)

The game is written in Java and is a Spring MVC app, which means you will need a Java-based servlet container (web server) to run.
